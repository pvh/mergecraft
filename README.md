# Mergecraft

A collab.

## Working on it

You'll need `pnpm` installed, and to point "@patchwork/sdk" in package.json to a checked out (and built) version of patchwork.

Then, make some changes, and run the following:

$ pnpm i
$ pnpm build
$ jacquard push

Open the folder in Jacquard and register the folder containing package.json in My Tools. (Sorry, this should be better.)
